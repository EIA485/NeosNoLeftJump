archival notice, Banane9 made a fork that allows you to toggle the active state of each thumbstick [Banane9/NeosMaybeJump](https://github.com/Banane9/NeosMaybeJump)

# NoLeftJump

A [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mod for [Neos VR](https://neos.com/) that disables your left thumbstick being used as a jump.

## Installation
1. Install [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader).
1. Place [NoLeftJump.dll](https://github.com/eia485/NeosNoLeftJump/releases/latest/download/NoLeftJump.dll) into your `nml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\NeosVR\nml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with NeosModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
1. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Neos logs.
